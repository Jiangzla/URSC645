# Are you a scientist?
Simply stated: Scientist do science... so

"Everyone is a scientist...

From the moment you ask how and where - You are a scientist!

When you explore by experiment and build from the imagination - You are a scientist!

Where you allow your curiosity to wander as you pursue a solution - You are a scientist!

When you push the frontiers of innovation to new heights of discovery - You are a scientist!"

# What is Science?

Summary of readings that discuss and define science.

Research is a "systematic investigation or inquiry aimed at contributing to knowledge of a theory, topic, etc., by careful consideration, observation, or study of a subject." ([OED Online](https://www-oed-com.srv-proxy2.library.tamu.edu/view/Entry/163432?rskey=sD70JD&amp;result=1), 2020). 

Research is a fundamental part of science. Research involves a significant investment of time, application of methods, and decisions.

"Science demands reproducibility" (Long 2009, p. 2)


## Motivating quotes:

Motivating quote from NYTimes Science section (Overbye, 2023): 

> ### "…the hallmark of great science: You ask a question, and often it turns out to be the wrong question, but you have to ask a question to find out it’s the wrong one. If it is, you ask a new one." Michael Turner theoretical cosmologist

> ### "Science is all about big dreams... beyond your immediate reach. But science has always allowed humankind to do big things that extend our vision and power to shape our future... If we continue to dream big and work together even more amazing things lie head." - Michael Turner theoretical cosmologist

> ### "Mathematics is the language of science." - Michael Turner theoretical cosmologist 

> ### If it is not testable, at least not yet, it is not science.

## Explicating Assumptions
"Paradigm shifts emerge when scientists or others question their assumptions (tacit or explicit). Van Neurath (cited in Harste et al., 1984, p. 85) uses the metaphor of shipbuilding to describe this process. “Scientists are like sailors who have to rebuild their ships at high sea, without being able to seek port. Each plank in the hull may be jettisoned in the process, but it is not feasible to jettison all of the planks at the same time.” Thus, the “ships” of knowledge are built with pieces of wood (assumptions). The “worth” of each piece has to be examined from time to time. The pieces that are outdated by new information or disproven need to be jettisoned. Based on this metaphor, we can say that “knowing” is about making and testing assumptions. Science is an activity of reflective thinking. Brookfield (1995) calls this “hunting assumptions,” and Fogarty (1994) calls it “meta-cognition,” reflecting on how we think, how we know, and how we learn." (Nkwake 2020 p. 88)

## Stop and Think - Think Hard

Does the tool help you engage with the world, think about different future outcomes, and communicate your story?

Before asking a scientific model (an oracle (Eidinow 2018)) - prepare diligently and phrase your research question carefully. Consider what answer will the model create and how will those answers lead to different possibilities? Often the answers provided by models (GPS, a medical diagnostic tool... (Harford 2019)) are taken without question, thought or engagement. Harford (2019) gives examples of how using GPS to navigate a route limits engagement and when asked to walk the same route without help those who used a paper map were more confident. Sometimes a model can be "too good", and therefore we don't stop and think about questions we ask or the answers we receive. An example of a model that appears to be "too good" is Internet Protocol (IP) address mapping. Assumptions about how to locate where an IP address is physically located led to a house in the middle of Kansas being assumed to be the location of significant criminal activity (Hill, 2016).

## Example of bias: Arbitrary decisions have unintended consequences

Wind turbines are designed to go in a clockwise direction, simply because that’s how people designed them without necessarily thinking of going in an anti-clockwise direction. But it turns out that if the turbines could go in both directions they would be more efficient at night.

## “Grandma’s Ham”, A Story of Cultural Training

Family cuts the ends of their hams because that is how their grandparents did it, it seems like a tradition. But they did not realize that their grandparents cut the ends off because the oven/pan was too small. An example of cultural bias.

## How convenience sample sparks the scientific process 
Story about how loose moon rocks collected during the Apollo 11 mission have provided 50 years of research that has led to new questions and motivated more systematic sampling of the moon.

"There's still a lot of good science to be done on the Apollo samples. This is the culmination of development of new, more sensitive instruments. We can look at smaller scales, and we're able to do more with less -- we can do some studies with a fraction of a gram. and with new scientists and new ideas, we can open up whole new avenues of research." Ryan Zeigler curator of the lunar collection and head of the Astromaterials Acquisition and Curation Office at NASA's Johnson Space Center.

"The Apollo samples were collected from just six locations on the Moon, and provide insights into a limited set of lunar formations." Benningfield p. 9

"We absolutely need to collect more samples from other areas to answer key questions about the origin and evolution of the Moon. The Apollo samples, though invaluable in their own right, were collected as 'float' rocks loose in the lunar regolith, without important geologic context for where they orginated. As our understanding of the Moon has evolved -- mostly as a result of analyses of these loose rocks -- our need for samples from more selective areas has grown." Debra Needham of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center.

New samples could tamp down interest in the Apollo collection -- but not for long. "People would go and study the new rocks. That would raise more questions, so they would come back to the Apollo sampels to check and cross check. So I think they're going to be a valuable collections forever, essentially. I'm not worried about going out of business any time soon." Ryan Zeigler curator of the lunar collection and head of the Astromaterials Acquisition and Curation Office at NASA's Johnson Space Center.
