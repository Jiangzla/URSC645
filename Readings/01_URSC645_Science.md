# What is Science?

Summary of readings that discuss and define science.


## Motivating quotes:

Motivating quote from NYTimes Science section (Overbye, 2023): 

> ### "…the hallmark of great science: You ask a question, and often it turns out to be the wrong question, but you have to ask a question to find out it’s the wrong one. If it is, you ask a new one." Michael Turner theoretical cosmologist

> ### "Science is all about big dreams... beyond your immediate reach. But science has always allowed humankind to do big things that extend our vision and power to shape our future... If we continue to dream big and work together even more amazing things lie head." - Michael Turner theoretical cosmologist

> ### "Mathematics is the language of science." - Michael Turner theoretical cosmologist 

> ### If it is not testable, at least not yet, it is not science.

## Stop and Think - Think Hard

Does the tool help you engage with the world, think about different future outcomes, and communicate your story?

Before asking a scientific model (an oracle (Eidinow 2018)) - prepare diligently and phrase your research question carefully. Consider what answer will the model create and how will those answers lead to different possibilities? Often the answers provided by models (GPS, a medical diagnostic tool... (Harford 2019)) are taken without question, thought or engagement. Harford (2019) gives examples of how using GPS to navigate a route limits engagement and when asked to walk the same route without help those who used a paper map were more confident. Sometimes a model can be "too good", and therefore we don't stop and think about questions we ask or the answers we receive.
