# Welcome to the Readings Folder
## Readings	   
- Collection for readings (mainly PDF files) that support the project
- readings may be journal articles, reports, newspaper articles, or other documents
			
## Readings\Archive   
- The archive folder contains files that can be archived
- These files might include 
	- prior versions of the ReadMeFirst files
	- prior versions of the Annotated Bibliography
	- prior versions Readings (versions without comments or older editions of a publication)
	- Readings that after review were decided to not support the project

## Readings\Subfolder 
- As the collection of readings grows it might be appropriate to create subfolders
- The subfolders in the Readings folder help to group readings
- Readings could be group by:
1. Important or seminal articles
	- Important = a reading that everyone on the task should be familiar with
	- Seminal = a reading that strongly influences the project 
2. Key theoretical concepts
3. Readings that apply an important methodology
4. Readings that describe or use an important dataset

## [Annotated Bilbliography](https://github.com/npr99/URSC645/blob/main/Readings/00_URSC645_AnnotatedBibliography.md)
- A collection of summaries of the readings to help keep track of key topics
- Unlike the individual readings files the Annotated Bibliography can be shared publicly


## File Name Structure
File names for readings should reflect the in text citation for the reading and why the reading is included in the project. The file name should be structured as follows:

```
