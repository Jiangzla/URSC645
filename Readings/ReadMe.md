# Welcome to the Readings Folder
Readings	   
- Collection for readings (mainly PDF files) that support the project
- readings may be journal articles, reports, newpaper articles, or other documents
			
Readings\Archive   
- The archive folder contains files that can be archived
- These files might include 
	- prior versions of the ReadMeFirst files
	- prior versions of the Annotated Bibliography
	- prior versions Readings (versions without comments or older editions of a publication)
	- Readings that after review were decided to not support the project

Readings\Subfolder 
- As the collection of readings grows it might be appropriate to create subfolders
- The subfolders in the Readings folder help to group readings
- Readings could be group by:
1. Important or seminal articles
	- Important = a reading that everyone on the task should be familiar with
	- Seminal = a reading that strongly influences the project 
2. Key theoretical concepts
3. Readings that apply an important methodology
4. Readings that describe or use an important dataset

[Annotated Bilbliography](https://github.com/npr99/URSC645/blob/main/Readings/00_URSC645_AnnotatedBibliography.md)
- A collection of summaries of the readings to help keep track of key topics
- Unlike the individual readings files the Annotated Bibliography can be shared publicly
