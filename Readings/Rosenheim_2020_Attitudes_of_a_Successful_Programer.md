I often see questions along the lines of &quot;How do I know if I&#39;ll succeed as a programmer?&quot; In fact, I think this is a major barrier to entry in people&#39;s minds when they don&#39;t have any formal training in computing. The good news is that I have rarely found a student that couldn&#39;t learn to program. Programming is a basic human skill, just like reading, writing and arithmetic. Anyone can learn to program with time and effort. Students that develop the following attitudes will succeed as a programmer.

## Be curious about computers and how technology works

The world of technology is like a huge ocean of interesting domains, inter-connected ideas, and possibilities that can excite the imagination. Be curious, push yourself find something new that you haven&#39;t noticed before, recognize the vast ocean and dive a little deeper.

## Develop the ability to solve problems

Be confident in your ability to learn. All programming languages have documentation and specifications that are very explicit about how the language works. It&#39;s like using a dictionary — when you see a word you don&#39;t recognize, you look it up. The quickest, most reliable way to build your skill as a programmer is to force yourself to google it and check the documentation.

## Have patient acceptance

Whenever you begin working on a program you will encounter a whole &quot;stack&quot; of challenges. Once you resolve one problem, there is almost always another challenge right behind it. You are making progress, but there are always new problems to face. Every challenge you face and overcome gives you deeper understanding and a better ability to face new challenges, and quickly resolve old ones.

## Feel a sense of excitement and accomplishment

There is actually a dopamine hit that get when you overcome a problem. We all know that there is a good feeling that comes from persisting through a challenge and then finally winning at the end. Whenever you solve a problem that you struggled with, no matter how small, take pride in your accomplishment. Take a break and congratulate yourself for a job well done. Feel proud that you have taken a step forward, even if it is a small one. There is a lot to learn, and the journey of programming never ends, but the knowledge is cumulative. Trust that every effort you take in your learning will create a strong foundation of knowledge for wherever your career takes you.

## Exercise your mind

Programming is a thinking activity and thinking literally burns physical energy just like exercising our bodies. Just like going to the gym, the more that you do it, the stronger you will get. Trust that your brain is like a muscle — as you use it, it gets better and more efficient in its thinking. As you put pieces together and develop mental concepts, it becomes much easier to discover solutions.

## Get Creative

Programming is more like writing poems, there is beauty that can be seen in code. The reasons you decided on your solution, and the way you conceived of your answer is more important than the &quot;right way&quot; or the &quot;wrong way&quot;. Having the mind of an artist allows you to play with options and possibilities. That is the beauty of programming, there are many ways to solve a problem.

## Pay Attention to the Details

Computers are precise machines. When it comes to programming a computer, you need to provide the necessary commands precisely in the way a computer expects. That means that when you are programming you have to have an eye for details. Every space, bracket, or semi-colon counts. When out of place, nothing will work. If you miss details you could spend hours tracking down a problem that was literally the result of a typo. Accept that the details matter, scan your code for anything that is out of place. Organize your code and use tools that help you identify issues quickly.
