Bluks (2019) often sees questions along the lines of "How do I know if I'll succeed as a programmer?" In fact, I think this is a major barrier to entry in people's minds when they don't have any formal training in computing. The good news is that I have rarely found a student that couldn't learn to program. Programming is a basic human skill, just like reading, writing and arithmetic. Anyone can learn to program with time and effort. Students that develop the following attitudes will succeed as a programmer.

## Be curious about computers and how technology works

The world of technology is like a huge ocean of interesting domains, inter-connected ideas, and possibilities that can excite the imagination. Be curious, push yourself find something new that you haven't noticed before, recognize the vast ocean and dive a little deeper. Bluks (2019)

## Understand the why. 
What is the language for? What is it good for? Why should I learn it, what will it let me to do that I can't do today? Miller (2017)

## Develop the ability to solve problems

Be confident in your ability to learn. All programming languages have documentation and specifications that are very explicit about how the language works. It's like using a dictionary — when you see a word you don't recognize, you look it up. The quickest, most reliable way to build your skill as a programmer is to force yourself to google it and check the documentation. Bluks (2019)

## Survey what you don’t know yet, and learn what you can. 

For your first step, do a 'hello world,' print the numbers 1 to 20, or make a simple calculator. Once you're good at that, skim through the other language features to see which ones make sense and can help you do things you understand. Miller (2017)

## Have patient acceptance

Whenever you begin working on a program you will encounter a whole &quot;stack&quot; of challenges. Once you resolve one problem, there is almost always another challenge right behind it. You are making progress, but there are always new problems to face. Every challenge you face and overcome gives you deeper understanding and a better ability to face new challenges, and quickly resolve old ones. Bluks (2019)

## Feel a sense of excitement and accomplishment

There is actually a dopamine hit that get when you overcome a problem. We all know that there is a good feeling that comes from persisting through a challenge and then finally winning at the end. Whenever you solve a problem that you struggled with, no matter how small, take pride in your accomplishment. Take a break and congratulate yourself for a job well done. Feel proud that you have taken a step forward, even if it is a small one. There is a lot to learn, and the journey of programming never ends, but the knowledge is cumulative. Trust that every effort you take in your learning will create a strong foundation of knowledge for wherever your career takes you. Bluks (2019)

## Find interesting things to do. 

Don’t learn in a vacuum. You need to use things practically, you need to build muscle memory on the right way to use them. Figure out something you’re interested in. If you like books, maybe you want to write programs to analyze word count, sentence structure, what have you. If you like stocks, maybe you want to be able to parse a series of stock quotes and look for patterns. Find something interesting enough that solving it is possible, and motivates you. Miller (2017)

## Exercise your mind

Programming is a thinking activity and thinking literally burns physical energy just like exercising our bodies. Just like going to the gym, the more that you do it, the stronger you will get. Trust that your brain is like a muscle — as you use it, it gets better and more efficient in its thinking. As you put pieces together and develop mental concepts, it becomes much easier to discover solutions. Bluks (2019)

## Practice what you know and what you’ve just learned. 

Program. Get stuck, learn how to get unstuck. Get fluent at describing your current difficulty in Google question form. There’s always an answer out there you can understand, you just have to find it. Practice, practice, practice. Miller (2017)

## Get Creative

Programming is more like writing poems, there is beauty that can be seen in code. The reasons you decided on your solution, and the way you conceived of your answer is more important than the &quot;right way&quot; or the &quot;wrong way&quot;. Having the mind of an artist allows you to play with options and possibilities. That is the beauty of programming, there are many ways to solve a problem. Bluks (2019)

## Pay Attention to the Details

Computers are precise machines. When it comes to programming a computer, you need to provide the necessary commands precisely in the way a computer expects. That means that when you are programming you have to have an eye for details. Every space, bracket, or semi-colon counts. When out of place, nothing will work. If you miss details you could spend hours tracking down a problem that was literally the result of a typo. Accept that the details matter, scan your code for anything that is out of place. Organize your code and use tools that help you identify issues quickly. Bluks (2019)

## Rinse and repeat. 

Go back to ‘survey…’ and repeat. Each cycle you’ll know a little more, and understand things better. Miller (2017)

URSC 645 is a support system of like-minded people. In this course you will find others who are learning to program and at about your level. Always try to find the answer yourself (Google) for at least thirty minutes before asking someone else. Be generous in your time helping others, but make sure they learn. This is best for everyone.
