# Annotated Bibliography [[TAMU Writing Center Guidance](https://writingcenter.tamu.edu/Students/Writing-Speaking-Guides/Alphabetical-List-of-Guides/Academic-Writing/Annotated-Bibliographies)]

## Introduction

This annotated bibliography highlights the following ideas and concepts as discussed in the literature:

1. Definitions of terms such as reproducible, replicable, workflow, science
2. Challenges associated with reproducible research
    - Social norms vs individual goals - tradeoffs
3. Computer coding, scripting, and programming concepts
4. Appropriate software for replicable research
5. Discussions of bias (what is better science?)

## The Problem (see [Foss and Waters 2015 ch. 4 p. 36-38](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SrfFZUZOqp3DL1yzezuqOmL--htJcLOH/view?usp=sharing))

_Principal Proposition [a statement that is known to be true]_:

- Research is a "systematic investigation or inquiry aimed at contributing to knowledge of a theory, topic, etc., by careful consideration, observation, or study of a subject." ([OED Online](https://www-oed-com.srv-proxy2.library.tamu.edu/view/Entry/163432?rskey=sD70JD&amp;result=1), 2020)
- Research is a fundamental part of science. Research involves a significant investment of time, application of methods, and decisions.
- "Science demands reproducibility" (Long 2009, p. 2)

_Interacting proposition [Cast doubt on principal proposition - insert contradictory information]_:

- Most research is not reproducible because many of the research methods are not clearly documented, tools (software) is not always available, the contextual natural laboratory external factors not controllable…. (something like this comeback to this point)...
- Individualistic nature of research - Judanne Lennox "I struggled to get these results, you need to struggle too…" 
- Research needs to be new and novel - so why would you want to replicate something already done...

_Speculative proposition [put principal and interacting propositions side by side and name the gap of knowledge that exists]:_

Researchers lack the skills for building a strong workflow to support urban and regional analytic research that is systematic, generalizable, and replicable. Researchers that invest time to develop skills for reproducible research will be able to accomplish better science in less time.

## Research Question:

## How do reproducible workflow skills affect the quality and efficiency of science?

## Audience

This annotated bibliography for academic researchers interested in reproducible research.

Schulyer Carter - "Promoting transparency helps people be more open, oral history example"

"In a high-dimensional dataset, there may be hundreds or thousands of reasonable approaches to analysing the same data...If several thousand potential analytical pipelines can be applied to high-dimensional data, the generation of false-positive findings is highly likely." (demonstrates the importance and possible difficulty of being able to reproduce a finding using the exact original method) - MCS

Pre-registration may involve conflict of interest as well, especially when the researcher needs money to do their research. For example, big pharmaceutical companies pay for the clinical trials and keep the researchers from publishing non-favorable results even if pre-registration is in place.

Outcome bias is quite common. Researchers tend to rewrite their hypotheses after analysis. (Is changing measures/variables of a concept an example of outcome bias too?)

Current academic incentive system works opposite way from encouraging people to share research data.

A panelist during a disaster conference in 2018: "If you don't want to share your data, you are an evil person." However, the question is, the system is evil and we have to play that evil game.

## Freese 2007

Freese, J. (2007). Replication standards for quantitative social science: Why not sociology?. _Sociological Methods &amp; Research_, _36_(2), 153-172.

Freese defines replicate as " the simple verification or duplication of results using the same data and analytic procedures as the original researcher." (p. 154) Freese points out within Sociology there is an implicit individualistic policy that all published research should be replicable. Freese argues that the responsibility to do replicate research should be based on a social contract.

| Individual policy | Social policy |
| --- | --- |
| If asked a researcher should be able to provide the files to replicate published results | Files to replicate published results are submitted at time of publication. |
| emphasis on trust over transparency, faith in the author, reinforcement of status, ethically obscure, expires with the individual | Reduce egalitarianism. Distributes power and access. Openness. Highlights exemplary work. |

"A number of Elsevier journals encourage authors to submit a data statement alongside their manuscript." "Several journals support co-submission of a data article alongside your manuscript. In each case, the data article is transferred to the open access journal _Data in Brief_ for publication."

Taylor &amp; Francis offers the following standardized data sharing policies across our journals ([Journal of the American Planning Association included):](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/rjpa20/current)

([https://authorservices.taylorandfrancis.com/understanding-our-data-sharing-policies/](https://authorservices.taylorandfrancis.com/understanding-our-data-sharing-policies/))

From 2018, Taylor &amp; Francis will be introducing new policies on data sharing….

- Basic – Journal encourages authors to share and make data open where this does not violate protection of human subjects or other valid subject privacy concerns. Authors are further encouraged to cite data and provide a data availability statement.
- Share upon reasonable request – Authors agree to make their data available upon reasonable request. It's up to the author to determine whether a request is reasonable.
- Publicly available – Authors make their data freely available to the public, under a license of their choice.
- Open data – Authors must make their data freely available to the public, under a license allowing re-use by any third party for any lawful purpose. Data shall be findable and fully accessible.
- Open and fully FAIR (Findable, accessible, interoperable and re-usable) – Authors must make their data freely available to the public, under a license allowing re-use by any third party for any lawful purpose. Additionally, data shall meet with FAIR standards as established in the relevant subject area.

## Lowndes et al 2017

"Integrating open data science practices and tools into science can save time, while also improving reproducibility for our most important collaborators: our future selves." - Lowndes et al

Lowndes, Julia S. Stewart, Benjamin D. Best, Courtney Scarborough, Jamie C. Afflerbach, Melanie R. Frazier, Casey C. O'Hara, Ning Jiang and Benjamin S. Halpern (2017). Our path to better science in less time using open data science tools. _Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution_, 1, 1-7.

### Introduction

Lowndes provides a methodological account of the open data tools that they use to improve their workflow (i.e. data preparation, modeling, coding, collaboration and sharing data).

### Argument

It is often implied that good science is science that is reproducible. One of the main challenges across disciplines is making data accessible, transparent and collaborative. The author introduces various open data science tools that can make the process of reproducibility and collaboration easier. Shifting from an individual to collaborative approach to data analysis is beneficial by allowing for analysis and interpretation to become a collaborative learning process resulting in individual and collective growth and improvement.

### Audience

An experienced community of data analysts and researchers interested in collaboration and improving methodology through collaboration.

### Content

Lowndes walks us through a number of methods and tools that her and collaborative research partners use to improve their workflow and the reproducibility of their work. Table 1 provided a summary of workflow tasks, primary open data tools and how tools have advanced to make workflow more efficient. For example, every time R Markdown output files are regenerated, the R code is rerun and the associated text and figures are also regenerated to reflect any updates to the code. Another resource they used was Git 44 as a version control system tool (which tracks changes within files and allows you to revert to previous version if needed). It takes snapshots of the changes being made line-by-line and throughout time.

1. Definition not mentioned.
2. Software usually creates barriers between researchers and restrains data sharing, because of the cost of software researchers use in their research. Further, individual data organizations place challenges in reproducing research. Workflow and sharing data organization is essential to overcome replicable research challenges.
3. Free software helps establish workflow and sharing data. Establishing workflow and sharing data improve data replicability, which cannot be based on individual data organization.
4. How free software tools and platforms can help collaborative research, improving workflow, and replicability. It uses an Ocean Health Index project as an example of replicability and collaboration research.Open sources also help reproducibility.
5. Emphasis on reproducibility, collaboration, and communication

### Argument:

Free software tools and platforms, like Github, can help collaborative research, improving workflow, and replicability, because it breaks the barriers between researchers.

1. The paper introduces a new lexicon for research reproducibility. (a) Methods reproducibility, the provision of enough detail about research procedures (e.g. how many analyses were performed) and data. (b) Results reproducibility refers to obtainings the same results from a conduct of an independent study whose procedures are as close as possible. (c) Inferential reproducibility refers to drawing the same conclusions from an either independent study or a reanalysis of the original study.
2. The article points out some of its basic terms - reproducibility, replicability, reliability, robustness, and generalizability - are not standardized, leading to both conceptual and operational confusion.
3. Not mentioned
4. Not mentioned
5. Conclusion: Ill-defined reproducibility can be improved by a clear specification of reproducibility (methods, results, or inferences) and how it affects knowledge.

### Argument

The researchers need to move toward a better understanding of the relationship between reproducibility, cumulative evidence, and the truth of scientific claims.

- Reproducible research is the idea that data analyses, and more generally, scientific claims, are published with their data and software code so that others may verify the findings and build upon them.
- Reproducibility allows for people to focus on the actual content of a data analysis, rather than on superficial details reported in a written summary.
- Reproducibility makes an analysis more useful to others because the data and code that actually conducted the analysis are available.
