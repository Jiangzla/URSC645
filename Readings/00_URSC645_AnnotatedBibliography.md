# Annotated Bibliography

## Introduction

This annotated bibliography highlights the following ideas and concepts as discussed in the literature:

1. Definitions of terms such as reproducible, replicable, workflow, science
2. Challenges associated with reproducible research
    - Social norms vs individual goals - tradeoffs
3. Computer coding, scripting, and programming concepts
4. Appropriate software for replicable research
5. Discussions of bias (what is better science?)

## The Problem

Research is a fundamental part of science that involves a significant investment of time, systematic application of methods, and careful consideration. 
"Science demands reproducibility" (Long 2009, p. 2) therefore reproducible research is a fundamental part of science. 
However, most research is not reproducible because many of the research methods are not clearly documented and tools or software are not always available.
Additionally, within the social sciences there is a general sense while research should be reproducible, the requirements are left to individual researchers.
To overcome the gap between the demand for reproducible research and the lack the skills to build reproducibility into projects, researchers need to invest time to develop data science skills. Data science skill can help build a strong workflow to support urban and regional analytic research that is systematic, generalizable, and replicable. Researchers that invest time to develop skills for reproducible research will be able to accomplish better science in less time.

## Research Question:

_How do reproducible workflow skills affect the quality and efficiency of science?_

The research question defines the sections to focus on in the literature review. Within each article review look for definitions and ways to measure the following terms:
1. reproducible
2. workflow 
3. workflow skills
4. quality of science
5. efficiency of science

## Audience

This annotated bibliography for academic researchers interested in reproducible research.

Munafò, M. R., Nosek, B. A., Bishop, D. V., Button, K. S., Chambers, C. D., du Sert, N. P., Simonsohn, U., Wagenmakers, E., Ware, J.J., & Ioannidis, J. P. (2017). A manifesto for reproducible science. Nature Human Behaviour, 1, 0021. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-016-0021 

In their article, Munafò et al. (2017) provide a strong argument for why reproducible science is important. The authors describe the potential for various forms of bias to lead to self-deception. Broadly, the areas to address are with individual scientists, the availability of large datasets and potential for rapid data analysis, and systems that do not incentivize transparent research. The authors argue that currently reproducibility and transparency are not the norms in social science, but that the benefits will lead to an eventual shift in the culture.

Practices such as blinding, pre-regristration, and continuing education in modular form are provided as ways to reduce bias, improve transparency and reproducibility. There are numerous resources that could help encourage transparency and reproducibility.

Freese defines replicate as " the simple verification or duplication of results using the same data and analytic procedures as the original researcher." (p. 154) Freese points out within Sociology there is an implicit individualistic policy that all published research should be replicable. Freese argues that the responsibility to do replicate research should be based on a social contract.

| Individual policy | Social policy |

From 2018, Taylor &amp; Francis will be introducing new policies on data sharing….

- Basic – Journal encourages authors to share and make data open where this does not violate protection of human subjects or other valid subject privacy concerns. Authors are further encouraged to cite data and provide a data availability statement.
- Share upon reasonable request – Authors agree to make their data available upon reasonable request. It's up to the author to determine whether a request is reasonable.
- Publicly available – Authors make their data freely available to the public, under a license of their choice.
- Open data – Authors must make their data freely available to the public, under a license allowing re-use by any third party for any lawful purpose. Data shall be findable and fully accessible.
- Open and fully FAIR (Findable, accessible, interoperable and re-usable) – Authors must make their data freely available to the public, under a license allowing re-use by any third party for any lawful purpose. Additionally, data shall meet with FAIR standards as established in the relevant subject area.

## Lowndes et al 2017

"Integrating open data science practices and tools into science can save time, while also improving reproducibility for our most important collaborators: our future selves." - Lowndes et al

Lowndes, Julia S. Stewart, Benjamin D. Best, Courtney Scarborough, Jamie C. Afflerbach, Melanie R. Frazier, Casey C. O'Hara, Ning Jiang and Benjamin S. Halpern (2017). Our path to better science in less time using open data science tools. _Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution_, 1, 1-7.

### Introduction

Lowndes provides a methodological account of the open data tools that they use to improve their workflow (i.e. data preparation, modeling, coding, collaboration and sharing data).

### Argument

It is often implied that good science is science that is reproducible. One of the main challenges across disciplines is making data accessible, transparent and collaborative. The author introduces various open data science tools that can make the process of reproducibility and collaboration easier. Shifting from an individual to collaborative approach to data analysis is beneficial by allowing for analysis and interpretation to become a collaborative learning process resulting in individual and collective growth and improvement.

### Audience

An experienced community of data analysts and researchers interested in collaboration and improving methodology through collaboration.

### Content

Lowndes walks us through a number of methods and tools that her and collaborative research partners use to improve their workflow and the reproducibility of their work. Table 1 provided a summary of workflow tasks, primary open data tools and how tools have advanced to make workflow more efficient. For example, every time R Markdown output files are regenerated, the R code is rerun and the associated text and figures are also regenerated to reflect any updates to the code. Another resource they used was Git 44 as a version control system tool (which tracks changes within files and allows you to revert to previous version if needed). It takes snapshots of the changes being made line-by-line and throughout time.

1. Definition not mentioned.
2. Software usually creates barriers between researchers and restrains data sharing, because of the cost of software researchers use in their research. Further, individual data organizations place challenges in reproducing research. Workflow and sharing data organization is essential to overcome replicable research challenges.
3. Free software helps establish workflow and sharing data. Establishing workflow and sharing data improve data replicability, which cannot be based on individual data organization.
4. How free software tools and platforms can help collaborative research, improving workflow, and replicability. It uses an Ocean Health Index project as an example of replicability and collaboration research.Open sources also help reproducibility.
5. Emphasis on reproducibility, collaboration, and communication

### Argument:

Free software tools and platforms, like Github, can help collaborative research, improving workflow, and replicability, because it breaks the barriers between researchers.

Gentzkow and Shapiro 2014

**Chapter 4 - Directories**

**Key Words:**

*   Rundirectory.bat: single script that executes a directory from start to finish
*   /temp
*   /output

**Rules:**

1.  Separate directories by function.
2.  Separate files into inputs and outputs.
3.  Make directories portable.

**Summary:**  
Separating directories by purpose makes it easier to intentionally modify the encapsulated analysis without having to rerun all the unrelated scripts, and it makes it possible to use local references. To get around this set-up breaking on a different machine where the local links are not valid, one can link to fixed revisions of the dataset on shared network storage, which the user can then decide to update once the user is satisfied with the new revision.

---

**Chapter 5 - Keys**

**Key Words:**

*   Relational database: a database format whose physical structure communicates the logic behind it to be self-documenting
*   Table: rectangular arrays in which data are stored
*   Element: The row of a table
*   Variable: the column of a table, which is an attribute of the table’s elements
*   Key: a variable or set of variables that uniquely identifies the elements of a table. The variables that form the key never take on missing values, and a key’s value is never duplicated across rows of the table
*   Foreign key: the key for another table in the database
*   Normalized: a form of data that is easier to understand because the data are organized to be similar across all records

**Rules:**

1.  Store cleaned data in tables with unique, non-missing keys.
2.  Keep data normalized as far into your code pipeline as you can.

**Summary:**  
Managing complex datasets is possible, and it begins with ensuring that “the physical structure of a database \[communicates\] its logical structure” (19). The authors illustrate this by creating a toy relational database of the effect of television on potato chip consumption in New York and Virginia, in which the authors normalize the data. To perform an analysis on a relational database, the tables of the database must be merged (joined) into a single array, at which point the data will likely no longer be normalized. The authors describe this process using their toy relational database.

---

**Chapter 6 - Abstraction**

**Key Words:**

*   Abstraction: turning the specific instances of something into a general-purpose tool

**Rules:**

1.  Abstract to eliminate redundancy.
2.  Abstract to improve clarity.
3.  Otherwise, don’t abstract.

**Summary:**  
Copying and pasting code can propagate errors. A less error-prone alternative is abstraction, developing general-purpose code (e.g., functions, classes, scripts, etc.) that can cleanly be applied to the specific situation of interest as well as to future projects. Abstraction eliminates redundancy and makes code more readable. However, be sure to double-check that the abstraction works as intended and to not abstract without a purpose.

---

**Chapter 7 - Documentation**

**Key Words:**

*   Commenting code
*   Documentation

**Rules:**

1.  Don’t write documentation you will not maintain.
2.  Code should be self-documenting.

**Summary:**  
Over-commenting code is an issue if the code is later changed but the comment is not updated; in this scenario, the comment no longer accurately reflects the code. The authors state, “If it’s not worth maintaining a piece of documentation up to \[standard\], it probably isn’t worth writing it in the first place (rule \[1\])” (27). Thus to make code clear without extensive comments that ultimately may have a limited shelf-life, the authors suggest making code self-documenting (rule 2) by guiding the reader through the code’s operations using the variable names and code’s structure. This self-documentation is applicable to more than just code (e.g., purpose of relational databases, filenames, directory names, figures, etc.). Also, while documenting can help prevent unintended behavior (e.g., through a warning), it is often more effective to write preventative code (that doesn’t allow the unintended behavior) than a preventative message (which relies on the user reading and respecting the comments).

---

**Chapter 8 - Management**

**Key Words:**

*   Task management system
*   Collaborative note-taking environment

**Rules:**

1.  Manage tasks with a task management system.
2.  E-mail is not a task management system.

**Summary:**  
Task management issues are simpler to untangle when one is working alone, but these issues propagate with bigger teams. Using a task management system for collaboration can reduce ambiguity about tasks, goals, and assignments. These systems also store task-specific records of “who did what and why” (33). The authors recommend Asana (www.asana.com), Wrike (www.wrike.com), and Flow (www.getflow.com) as good free options, although the authors use a paid program called JIRA. The authors also recommend using a collaborative note-taking environment to develop and share project notes such as Evernote (www.evernote.com - free) or OneNote (included in Microsoft Office).

---

**Appendix - Code Style**

**Key Words:**

*   Slow code: code that one plans to rarely change

**Principles of writing good code:**

1.  Keep it short and purposeful.
2.  Make your functions shy.
    1.  Functions should explicitly declare inputs and outputs and only operate on local variables.
3.  Order your functions for linear reading.
4.  Use descriptive names.
5.  Pay special attention to coding algebra.
    1.  Make sure that key calculations are clearly set off from the rest of the code.
    2.  Break complicated algebraic calculations into pieces.
6.  Make logical switches intuitive.
7.  Be consistent.
8.  Check for errors.
9.  Write tests for just about every piece of code to make sure that the code does everything it is expected to do.
10.  Profile slow code relentlessly.
11.  Store “too much” output from slow code.
12.  Separate slow code from fast code.

Annotated Bibliography [TAMU Writing Center Guidance]
Introduction
This annotated bibliography highlights the following ideas and concepts as discussed in the literature:

Definitions of terms such as reproducible, replicable, workflow, science
Challenges associated with reproducible research
Social norms vs individual goals - tradeoffs
Computer coding, scripting, and programming concepts
Appropriate software for replicable research
Discussions of bias (what is better science?)
The Problem (see Foss and Waters 2015 ch. 4 p. 36-38)
Principal Proposition [a statement that is known to be true]:

Research is a "systematic investigation or inquiry aimed at contributing to knowledge of a theory, topic, etc., by careful consideration, observation, or study of a subject." (OED Online, 2020)

"research, n.1". OED Online. December 2020. Oxford University Press. https://www-oed-com.srv-proxy2.library.tamu.edu/view/Entry/163432?rskey=sD70JD&result=1 (accessed January 29, 2021).

Research is a fundamental part of science. Research involves a significant investment of time, application of methods, and decisions.

"Science demands reproducibility" (Long 2009, p. 2)

Interacting proposition [Cast doubt on principal proposition - insert contradictory information]:

Most research is not reproducible because many of the research methods are not clearly documented, tools (software) is not always available, the contextual natural laboratory external factors not controllable…. (something like this comeback to this point)...

Individualistic nature of research - Judanne Lennox "I struggled to get these results, you need to struggle too…" - Research needs to be new and novel - so why would you want to replicate something already done...

Speculative proposition [put principal and interacting propositions side by side and name the gap of knowledge that exists]:

Researchers lack the skills for building a strong workflow to support urban and regional analytic research that is systematic, generalizable, and replicable. Researchers that invest time to develop skills for reproducible research will be able to accomplish better science in less time.

Research Question:
How do reproducible workflow skills affect the quality and efficiency of science?
Audience

Munafo et al 2017
Schulyer Carter - "Promoting transparency helps people be more open, oral history example"

"In a high-dimensional dataset, there may be hundreds or thousands of reasonable approaches to analysing the same data...If several thousand potential analytical pipelines can be applied to high-dimensional data, the generation of false-positive findings is highly likely." (demonstrates the importance and possible difficulty of being able to reproduce a finding using the exact original method) - MCS

Pre-registration may involve conflict of interest as well, especially when the researcher needs money to do their research. For example, big pharmaceutical companies pay for the clinical trials and keep the researchers from publishing non-favorable results even if pre-registration is in place.

Outcome bias is quite common. Researchers tend to rewrite their hypotheses after analysis. (Is changing measures/variables of a concept an example of outcome bias too?)

Current academic incentive system works opposite way from encouraging people to share research data.

A panelist during a disaster conference in 2018: "If you don't want to share your data, you are an evil person." However, the question is, the system is evil and we have to play that evil game.

Naming (e.g., computers, networks, files, etc.) feels like it should be intuitive, but developing good naming conventions requires some thought. Libes outlines what NOT to do:

*   Don’t overload other terms already in common use.
*   Don’t choose a name after a project unique to that machine.
*   Don’t use your own name.
*   Don’t use long names.
*   Avoid alternate spellings.
*   Avoid domain names.
*   Avoid domain-like names.
*   Don’t use antagonistic or otherwise embarrassing names.
*   Don’t use digits at the beginning of the name.
*   Don’t use non-alphanumeric characters in a name.
*   Don’t expect case to be preserved.
*   Use words/names that are rarely used.
*   Use theme names.
*   Use real words.
*   Don’t worry about reusing someone else’s hostname.
*   There is always room for an exception.

Fundamentally, Libes suggests choosing one’s computer name wisely.
