## Play around
Do not worry about breaking anything. The notebook is running on Google's servers. If you break something you can always go back to GitHub and reopen the notebook. You are not editing the original notebook. You are only editing a copy of the notebook.

The notebook is yours to play around with. You can change the code and see what happens. If you want to save your changes you will need to make a copy of the notebook. To do this click on File > Save a copy in Drive. This will save a copy of the notebook to your Google Drive. You can then open the notebook from your Google Drive and continue to make changes.
