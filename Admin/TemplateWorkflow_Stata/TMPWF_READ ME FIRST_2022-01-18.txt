Project Title: Template Work Flow for Reproducible Research
Project Funding: Texas A&M University, College of Architecture, 
	Department of Landscape Architecture and Urban Planning

Research Question: How do reproducible workflow skills affect 
                   the quality and efficiency of science?

Problem: 
Research is a fundamental part of science. Research involves a significant investment of time, application of methods, and decisions. Most research is not reproducible because many of the research methods are not clearly documented, tools (software) is not always available, the contextual natural laboratory external factors not controllableâ€¦. (something like this comeback to this point)... Researchers lack the skills for building a strong workflow to support urban and regional analytic research that is systematic, generalizable, and replicable. Researchers that invest time to develop skills for reproducible research will be able to accomplish better science in less time.

Folder Structure:
Admin 		- Budgets, Original Proposal, Annual Reports, Contract letters
SourceData 	- Folder structure mirrors web address (folder structure)
Posted 		- Archived files needed for replicating work that has been shared - 
		--- journal article
		--- conference paper
		--- poster
		--- data archive
	 	- Files in Posted folder should not be altered, deleted, or modified.
Projects	- Active projects within larger project
Readings 	- Articles related to project
WorkNPR 	- Nathanael Rosenheim's Work Folder - individual work directory

File Nameing:
All files must start with the project or subproject mnemonic
All files should end with the date in the format YYYY-MM-DD

              description should be no more than 10 characters long.
              SAS requires data file names to be less than or equal to 32 characters long.
