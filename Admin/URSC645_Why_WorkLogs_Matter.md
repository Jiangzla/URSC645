# Introduction to Work Logs 
Work on explaining why keeping a work log (lab notebook) is important

A work log provides a means for keeping track and documenting the work accomplished on a project. Think of the work log as a diary of your efforts. The work log is for the individual researcher and provides a way to communicate with colleagues. 

The work log can be organized in many ways. In general it is best to have a work log for each project or task. A recommendation is to use a digital file that allows for adding screenshots of issues, notes on work, notes from meetings, and successes or complaints.

### Google Drive Work Logs:
Google Docs is an excellent option for keeping a work log. Google Docs provide a way to tag colleagues with issues, questions, or to assign tasks to colleagues.

### Ideas for organization
- Name your Work Log with the project mnemonic_WorkLOG[Initials].
- Set up your work log so that the top entry is the current date and the first entry is at the bottom.
- Keep the work log simple - it does not have to be written in a formal style or be a polished document.

### Example Work Log:

Keeping a laboratory notebook has a long tradition within engineering:

Mentioned by Scott Long 2009 in section about documentation.
Turns out to be a good summary of research notebooks - from the perspective of a chemist but seems general enough in principle for any scientist
