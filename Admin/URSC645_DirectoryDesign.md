## Directory and Folder Name Structure

**Admin**      = Administration Folder = Folder has files and guides to introduce project. 

**SourceData** = Folder contains data that many project members may want to use. 
The goal is to not have multiple copies of the same files. 
Also to preserve the original data and metadata.

**Projects** = [_Optional_] Folder contains subprojects for the main project - usually specific to an individual person or team.

**Tasks** = [_Optional_] Folder contains tasks - usually a specific activity that anyone on project may need to accomplish. For example, setting up the python environment or completing a specific training. Tasks are related to the main project or could be within a subproject.

**Work[]** = Work folders will be found inside a project or task folder. Work folder names include the initials of the person. For example, Nathanael's work folders are named WorkNPR (work folder for Nathanael P. Rosenheim). Work folders contain any files, documents, generated data... related to the specific project or task. Work folders should also include a WorkLog file specific to the project or task. 

**Posted** = Archived files needed for replicating work that has been shared - 
- journal article
- conference paper
- poster
- data archive
- work shared internally for the team
        
***Note on directory names*** Directory names should not contain spaces. Use Camel Case and/or underscores "_" to separate words.
