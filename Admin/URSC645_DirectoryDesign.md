## Directory and Folder Name Structure

**Admin**      = Administration Folder = Folder has files and guides to introduce project. 

**SourceData** = Folder contains data that many project members may want to use. 
The goal is to not have multiple copies of the same files. 
Also to preserve the original data and metadata.

**Projects** = Folder contains subprojects for the main project - usually specific to an individual person or team.

**Tasks** = Folder contains tasks - usually specific to a task. Tasks are related to the main project or could be within a subproject.

**Projects/Work[]** = Work folders inside a project or task folder. Work folder names includes the initials of the person. For example, Nathanael's work folders are named WorkNPR (work folder for Nathanael P. Rosenheim). Work folders contain any files, documents, generated data... related to the specific project or task.

**Posted** = Archived files needed for replicating work that has been shared - 
        --- journal article
        --- conference paper
        --- poster
        --- data archive
        
***Note on directory names*** Directory names should not contain spaces. Use Camel Case and/or underscores "_"
