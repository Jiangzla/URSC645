## Directory and Folder Name Structure

**Admin**      = Administration Folder = Folder has files and guides to introduce project. 

**SourceData** = Folder contains data that many project members may want to use. 
The goal is to not have multiple copies of the same files. 
Also to presrve the original data and metadata.

**Projects** = Folder contains projects - usually specific to an individual person or task.

**Projects/Work[]** = Work folders inside project folder. Work folder names includes the initials of the person. For example, Nathanael's work folders are named WorkNPR (work folder for Nathanael P. Rosenheim). Work folders contain any files, documents, generated data... related to the specific project.
