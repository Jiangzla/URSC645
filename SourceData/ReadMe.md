# Welcome to the SourceData folder

Folder contains data that many project members may want to use. 
The goal is to not have multiple copies of the same files. 
Also to preserve the original data and metadata.

## Folder Structure

Notice that the names of the folders in the `SourceData` folder reflect the name of the website or source of the data. For example, data from data.census.gov is in a folder named `data.census.gov`.

Having folders named after the source of the data will help remind future collaborators (including yourself) where the data came from. This directory design can also help when working to cite the data.
