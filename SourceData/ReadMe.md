# Welcome to the SourceData folder

Folder contains data that many project members may want to use. 
The goal is to not have multiple copies of the same files. 
Also to preserve the original data and metadata.

## Folder Structure

Notice that the names of the folders in the `SourceData` folder reflect the name of the website or source of the data. For example, data from [lehd.ces.census.gov](https://lehd.ces.census.gov/) is in a folder named `lehd_ces_census_gov`.

Having folders named after the source of the data will help remind future collaborators (including yourself) where the data came from. This directory design can also help when working to cite the data.

## NOTICE
Within the folder `lehd_ces_census_gov` there includes a ReadMe file with an overview of the data source. There is also detailed metadata for the included data files. 

A great SourceData folder will help any project member fully understand the source data.

## REMEMBER DO NOT CHANGE SOURCE DATA
After Source Data has been added to the folder ***DO NOT*** modify the data. 
The source data folder is designed to keep the source data in its original format. 

## _Side note_ = IF YOU MODIFY SOURCE DATA
Sometimes source data takes a long time to download and it may not be conceivable to store the original source data. 
In this case the source data folder should contain detailed instructions on how the original data file was modified.
These detailed instructions could be in the form of a text document or presentation. 
Or (and even better) include a script file (Jupyter Notebook) that shows the full workflow for obtaining and cleaning the source data.
The goal is to replicate how the source data was obtained.
