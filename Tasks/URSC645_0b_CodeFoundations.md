## Code Foundations

Students will work to replicate and follow a LinkedInLearning Course. Students will share their work logs and lead a class discussion on lessons learned.

### Instructions
1. Start your work log in the course shared Google Drive's [task folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TMiyGTt06IsPijZv_4qJqkmFmzRxgrX7?usp=drive_link). See the [Start a Work Log](https://github.com/npr99/URSC645/blob/main/Tasks/URSC645_0a_StartAWorkLog.md) for more details. 

2. Go to the [Code Foundations](https://github.com/npr99/URSC645/tree/main/Posted/CodeFoundations) folder within the course Posted folder.

Note - files in the Posted folder are archived files that are considered "stable" and "read only". 

3. Choose one of the notebooks in the Code Foundations folder. Click on the "Open in Colab" button and read through the notebook. As you read through the notebook you will have the option to run the code in the notebook. You can run the code by clicking on the play button next to each code cell.

You can also edit the code and play around with it to see how changing the code changes the output.

4. In your work log keep notes on your steps to run the code. If you run into any issues take a screen shot and include your issues in your work log. 

5. Use a Large Language Model (ChatGPT or Bard or Bing) to create function similar to the ones at the end of the Code Foundations notebook. Or create some block of code that you are curious about. Paste the code from the LLM to your notebook and run the notebook. 

6. Save your notebok to your personal Google Drive. Google Drive will create a new folder called "Colab Notebooks" and save your notebook there.

7. In class we will cover your experience by reviewing your work logs. So - PLEASE keep a detailed work log. Your grade for this assignment will be based on your work log.
