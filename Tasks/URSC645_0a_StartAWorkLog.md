# Introduction to Work Logs 
A work log is an important tool for documenting your work. A work log is in the spirit of a laboratory notebook (Kenare, 1985), which is used by scientists and engineers to document their work in great detail. Writing in a work log helps the researcher to stop and think about what they are working on. Too often researchers can be caught up in the moment and forget to document their work. "Writing good notes requires discipline and practice. It is a skill that does not come easily to most people." (Kanare, 1985, p. 13)

A work log provides a means for keeping track and documenting the work accomplished on a project. Think of the work log as a diary of your efforts. The work log is for the individual researcher and provides a way to communicate with colleagues. 

The work log can be organized in many ways. In general it is best to have a work log for each project or task. A recommendation is to use a digital file that allows for adding screenshots of issues, notes on work, notes from meetings, and successes or complaints.

### Google Drive Work Logs:
Google Docs is an excellent option for keeping a work log. Google Docs provide a way to tag colleagues with issues, questions, or to assign tasks to colleagues.

### Ideas for organization
- Name your Work Log with the project mnemonic_WorkLOG[Initials].
- Set up your work log so that the top entry is the current date and the first entry is at the bottom.
- Keep the work log simple - it does not have to be written in a formal style or be a polished document.

### Example Work Log:

Mentioned by Scott Long 2009 in section about documentation.
Turns out to be a good summary of research notebooks - from the perspective of a chemist but seems general enough in principle for any scientist
