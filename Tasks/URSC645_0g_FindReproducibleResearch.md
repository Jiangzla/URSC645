## Examples of Journal Policies for Data and Code Sharing
[The Journal of Politics GUIDELINES FOR DATA REPLICATION](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/journals/jop/data-replication)

“The Journal of Politics operates **a strict data replication policy effective January 1, 2021****. It is the policy of the JOP to publish papers only if the data used in the analysis are clearly documented, available, and the empirical findings reproducible.”

[American Economic Association Data and Code Availability Policy](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/data/data-code-policy)

“It is the policy of the American Economic Association to publish papers only if the data and code used in the analysis are clearly and precisely documented and access to the data and code is non-exclusive to the authors.”

[Journal of Financial Economics Data and Code Sharing Policy](https://www.jfinec.com/data-and-code-sharing-policy)

“Authors of accepted manuscripts that contain empirical work, numerical simulations, or experimental work must make available to the JFE any data, programs, and details for the computations necessary for replication. As soon as possible after acceptance, authors are expected to upload their data, programs, and detailed instructions for use to Mendeley Data, where it will be published under the author’s choice of reuse license.”

Nature Portfolio Reporting standards and availability of data, materials, code and protocols 

“An inherent principle of publication is that others should be able to replicate and build upon the authors' published claims. A condition of publication in a Nature Portfolio journal is that authors are required to make materials, data, code, and associated protocols promptly available to readers without undue qualifications. Any restrictions on the availability of materials or information must be disclosed to the editors at the time of submission. Any restrictions must also be disclosed in the submitted manuscript.

After publication, readers who encounter refusal by the authors to comply with these policies should contact the chief editor of the journal. In cases where editors are unable to resolve a complaint, the journal may refer the matter to the authors' funding institution and/or publish a formal statement of correction, attached online to the publication, stating that readers have been unable to obtain necessary materials to replicate the findings.”

[Journal of the American Planning Association Data Sharing Policy ](https://www.tandfonline.com/action/authorSubmission?journalCode=rjpa20&page=instructions#dsp)

“This journal applies the Taylor & Francis Basic Data Sharing Policy. Authors are encouraged to share or make open the data supporting the results or analyses presented in their paper where this does not violate the protection of human subjects or other valid privacy or security concerns.”

[Natural Hazards Research Data Policy:](https://www-springer-com.srv-proxy1.library.tamu.edu/journal/11069/submission-guidelines#Instructions%20for%20Authors_Research%20Data%20Policy)

“This journal operates a type 1 research data policy [Data sharing and data citation is encouraged] . The journal encourages authors, where possible and applicable, to deposit data that support the findings of their research in a public repository.”

[Landscape and urban planning Research Data](https://www.elsevier.com/journals/landscape-and-urban-planning/0169-2046/guide-for-authors)

“This journal requires and enables you to share data that supports your research publication where appropriate, and enables you to interlink the data with your published articles. Research data refers to the results of observations or experimentation that validate research findings. To facilitate reproducibility and data reuse, this journal also encourages you to share your software, code, models, algorithms, protocols, methods and other useful materials related to the project.”
