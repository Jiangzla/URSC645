# Set up GitHub Account

We will use GitHub for several course assignments. 
GitHub is a great resource for having a reproducible workflow.
GitHub is a great resource for collaborating with others.

Once you have an account set up, be sure to add your photo and a short bio to your profile.

Early on in the course you will have an opportunity to become a contributor to the course repository.
