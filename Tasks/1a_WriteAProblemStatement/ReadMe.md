The research process begins with the development of a problem statement and a research question.
These two pieces help to focus the data collection, cleaning, exploration, and eventually analysis. 


## The Problem:
According to Foss and Waters (2015), a problem includes three propositions - principle, interacting, and speculative. 
The _Principal Proposition_ is a statement that is known to be true.
The _Interacting proposition_ cast doubt on principal proposition and inserts contradictory information.
The _Speculative Proposition_ put principal and interacting propositions side by side and names the gap of knowledge that exists


## The research question:
The problem statement provides a guide for writing a research question.
The research question acts as a guide for analyzing your data. 
The research question helps to focus each part of a replicable workflow – 
what data will be needed, 
how the data will be cleaned, 
what elements of the data need to be explored, 
what types of models are appropriate for data analysis and 
what outlets will be interested in the results. 
Formulating your research question should be an iterative process, 
first knowing that it is important provides motivation to start writing, 
but as a research project develops it is ok to revise and clarify the guiding question. 
As a note of caution, avoid changing your research question to fit the model results. 
To help with writing a good research question Foss and Waters (2015) provide six criteria:

### Assessing Research Questions: 
A research question formulated according to the following criteria ensures that your study has a solid center that can hold all of the pieces of the study together:
1.	The research question clearly identifies the theoretical construct you are studying.
2.	The research question contains some suggestion of recognizability of the theoretical construct.
Will you be able to locate it and distinguish it easily from other constructs that appear in your data?
3.	The research question (usually) transcends your data.
4.	The research question identifies your study’s contribution to an understanding of the theoretical construct.
5.	The research question has the capacity to surprise.	Do you already know the answer?
6.	The research question can produce robust results.

## Argument vs Research Question:
While a research question can provide clarity and guidance for your research, an argument is what is needed to support a journal article. According to Belcher (2019) an argument is “an answered research question or confirmed hypothesis” (p. 67).


| Research Question	| Possible Arguments |
| -------- | ------- |
| Does x affect y when z is present? | x increases y when z is present. |
| | x decreases y when z is present. | 
| | x does not affect y when z is present. |
| | x affects y when z is present if… |

What arguments could you make based on your research question?

For an excellent discussion of how to write a strong argument see Belcher (2019) Week 2 – Advancing Your Argument. p. 60-87

# Example Problem Statement and Research Question

## Problem Statement
Researchers lack the skills for building a strong workflow to support urban and regional analytic research that is systematic, generalizable, and replicable. Researchers that invest time to develop workflow skills for reproducible research will be able to accomplish better science in less time.

## Research Question
How do reproducible workflow skills affect the quality and efficiency of science?

### Theoretical Constructs
The research question defines the sections to focus on in the literature review. Within each article review look for definitions and ways to measure the following terms:
* reproducible
* workflow
* workflow skills
* quality of science
* efficiency of science
